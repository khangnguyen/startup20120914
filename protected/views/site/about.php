<h3 style="margin-top: 30px">Why "Spinning Jennie"?</h3>
<p style="float:left; width:600px">Spinning Jennie is a name derived from the spinning jenny, a multi-spool spinning frame which was
invented in Britain at the beginning of the first industrial revolution, in 1764. The genius of this machine
was that it allowed to work with several spools at once. In the same sense, our concept rests on working
with several designers at the same time, spinning fashion pieces together, and leading young designers
to early success in a revolutionary way.</p>
